# PROBLEM 1
# Data: takehome2_Data_India_20150409
# About: Recent studies suggest that cooperative decision-making in one-shot interactions 
# is a history-dependent dynamic process: promoting intuition versus deliberation typically 
# has a positive effect on cooperation (dynamism) among people living in a cooperative setting 
# and with no previous experience in economic games on cooperation (history dependence). 
# Here, we report on a laboratory experiment exploring how these findings transfer to a 
# non-cooperative setting. We find two major results: (i) promoting intuition versus 
# deliberation has no effect on cooperative behaviour among inexperienced subjects living 
# in a non-cooperative setting; (ii) experienced subjects cooperate more than inexperienced 
# subjects, but only under time pressure. These results suggest that cooperation is a learning 
# process, rather than an instinctive impulse or a self-controlled choice, and that experience 
# operates primarily via the channel of intuition. Our findings shed further light on the 
# cognitive basis of human cooperative decision-making and provide further support for the 
# recently proposed social heuristics hypothesis.


# Using this data set, the authors have examined the effect of time pressure on cooperation.
# You will do a different analysis on this data set, examining whether biological sex (column name: sex) has
# any effect on self-perceived pressure (column name: pressure)

# Research question: Filtering the data for those in the "pressure" condition, is there a significant difference between males
# and females on the "pressure" variable? Conduct a t-test to find out.

# Import the data from GitHub, exams folder "takehome2_Data_India_20150409.csv"


# Filter the data for the relevant variables and rows.


# Sanitize the data


# Assumptions checks


# What kind of t-test will you implement?


# Implement a manual t-test calculation. Verify using the built-in function


# Reach a statistical and research conclusion.

# Data: takehome2_exercise_memory_data
# Background: The inconsistent results of the studies on whether acute exercise 
# can improve working memory and the small effect sizes of meta-analysis indicate 
# that there may be some moderating variables affecting the intensity of the 
# relationship between acute exercise and working memory. This research examined 
# the effects of different intensity acute exercise on the two types of working 
# memory.
#   Seventy-eight low-active college students aged 18 to 22 years were 
# selected and randomly assigned to four groups. The low-intensity group (n=19), 
# moderate-intensity group (n=19) and high-intensity group (n=19) completed 
# 30-min cycle ergometer exercise bouts separately at the intensity of 40%, 
# 60% and 80% of Vo2max, while the control group (n=21) read for 30-min. The 
# delayed match-to-sample test was used to test verbal and spatial working 
# memory after the intervention.

# Your Research Question: Is there a significant difference between the 
# low intensity (LG coded as 1) and the high intensity groups (HG coded as 3) in 
# terms of verbal-reasoning working memory accuracy (Accuracy_VerbalMem).
