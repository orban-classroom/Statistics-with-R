## About the Data Set: 
## The data set describes chimpanzees' risky behaviours and correlates to their 
## stress levels as measured by the presence of cortisol hormone, and their 
## testosterone levels, among other variables. 

## File name on GitHub: "takehome1_Rosati_etal_ChimpanzeeAdolescence-Data_TaskRelations.csv"



## Variables you will use are: "RiskAffectScore", "Sex"




## Research Question
## Are there sex differences in risk taking as measured by the RiskAffectScore variable?

## FILTER - 10%
## Create a filter that separates the data into male and female groups.




## DISTRIBUTION SHAPE - 30% 
## Create a combined histogram plotting the RiskAffectScore variable for the 
## males and females. Use guidance from homework4 to plot two histograms together
## Make sure the histograms have equal width





## Concept. Describe the visual appearance of the distribution's shape based on 
## expressions such as kurtosis and skewness (see textbook). 




## Concept. Does anything stand in terms of the extent of risk affect scores
## between males and females (outliers, range, min, max)





## CENTRAL TENDENCIES - 20%
## Where is the middle of the data -- for male vs female risk affect scores?
## Justify your answer using concepts of normality, and measures of central tendencies. 
## All calculations using the **manual method**
## Use the built-in functions to verify your work.
## Keep your work clean with headings and comment your code.






## Concept question: can the mean, median and mode be identical for a data set?






## VARIABILITY - 40%
## Compute the sums of squares, variance and standard deviation of each of the variables.
## Keep your work clean with headings and comment your code. 
## Compute interim variables (deviation scores, sums of squares)








## Report the means and standard deviations below
## What is your assessment? Does it look like there are differences in
## risk affect score given the amount of variability in the data?
