## About the Data Set: 
## The data set describes chimpanzees' risky behaviours and correlates to their 
## stress levels as measured by the presence of cortisol hormone, and their 
## testosterone levels, among other variables. 

## File name on GitHub: Rosati_etal_ChimpanzeeAdolescence-Data_TaskRelations


## Variables you will use are: "RiskAffectScore", "Cortisol", "Testosterone"



## NORMALITY - 30% 
## Assess each of the three variables for normality. Draw on your of knowledge of normal curves, 
## skew, kurtosis, outliers, variability to make your conclusions. Use technical language (as per textbook) and visualizations.
## such as histograms and boxplots to support your arguments. 
## Keep your work clean with headings and comment your code.








## CENTRAL TENDENCIES - 20%
## Where is the middle of the data -- for each of the three variables?
## Justify your answer using concepts of normality, and measures of central tendencies. 
## All calculations using the manual method (but you can use built-in functions for verification)
## Keep your work clean with headings and comment your code.






## Concept question: can the mean, median and mode be identical for a data set?



## VARIABILITY - 30%
## Compute variance and standard deviation of each of the three variables.
## Keep your work clean with headings and comment your code. 
## Compute interim variables (deviation scores, sums of squares)






## CORRELATIONS - 20%
## Compute the covariance and correlationship between the following variables: 
## RiskAffectScore x Cortisol
## RiskAffectScore x Testosterone
## Describe the relationship between each of those variables
