## R Lab Homework 3

## Follow these stylistic conventions
## 1. Have your own system of variable naming, and stick to it. I will be looking for consistency.
## 2. Use a single hashtag # for your comments. I will use ## for my comments.
## Use spaces carefully to organize your code. Make it readable. You can use hashtags to add headings and comments to your code.

## Compute the mean of each variable using the "slow way."


## Compute the mean of each variable either using the super fast or the extra super fast ways.


## Compute the median of each of the two variables in the data frame using "slow way."


## Compute the median of each of the two variables in the data frame using "fast way."


## Compute the mode of each of the two variables in the data frame using the only way we learned.


## Generate a histogram for each of the variables, and describe their shape using concept from Chapter 5 (skewness, kurtosis, normality). 
## Add your comments as hashtags


## Generate a boxplot for each of the variables


## Save your work as an R script file, and upload it to Moodle.
