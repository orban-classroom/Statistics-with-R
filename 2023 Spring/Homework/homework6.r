## Homework 6

## For this homework, you will use a new data file called PSYC 1100 exam data. 
## This file contains midterm and final exam scores for several PSYC 1100 courses a few years ago. 
## Raw Github link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orban-classroom/Statistics-with-R/master/2019%20Spring/data/1100examdata/1100_exam_data.csv

## Research question: What is the relationship between midterm and final exam grades? Is a student who does well on a midterm also likely to do well on a final exam?

## Conduct a correlation analysis, manually. 
## Also create a boxplot, and a scatter plot with a regression line. 

## Tips: 
## Show all work, assign variables where it makes sense
## Remove unnecessary scrap code
## Do not hardcode numbers anytime
## Remove redundant code and duplicate variables
## Use headings and narrate your notebook
