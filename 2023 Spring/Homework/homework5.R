## Homework 5

## In this homework, you will work with a new dataset that describes various 
## mental health metrics of university students from Japan. Skim PDF to get an idea:
## https://github.com/orban-classroom/Statistics-with-R/blob/master/2023-spring/data/studentmentalhealth/pone.0218357.pdf

## Import the data from Table 1: 
## https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orban-classroom/Statistics-with-R/master/2023-spring/data/studentmentalhealth/Sheet%201-Table%201.csv

# 1. Compute the standard deviation of the following two variables: 
## WAIS_FIQ (their IQ scores)
## HR..mean. (the average heart rate during the study)

## Show part calculations for sample size, degrees of freedom, mean, deviation scores, sum of squares, and variance
## Verify your answers wherever possible
## Tips: Avoid redundant code, (2) assign part calculations to variables, (3) do not include unnecessary code


# 2. Compute the covariance between the two variables, WAIS_FIQ and HR..mean.
## In essence, we are asking the research question, is anxiety, as measured by heart rate 
## associated with lower or higher scores on the WAIS intelligence scale?

## Show part calculations: deviation scores, covariance
## More Tips: (1) Use variables you defined in part 1

# 3. What is the direction of the relationship between intelligence scores and heart rate?


# 4. Why can you not make a comment about the magnitude of the relationship?
