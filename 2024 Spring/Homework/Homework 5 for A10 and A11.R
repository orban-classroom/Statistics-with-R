## Homework 5
##############

## You will use a new data set for this week, dealing with disgust sensitivity
## View the package here: https://github.com/orban-classroom/Statistics-with-R/tree/master/2024-spring/Data/disgustscale

## Read about the data set by looking at the 10-91-1-PB.pdf file.

## Load the disgust sensitivity data from the GitHub folder:
## Load the data file: Berger_and_Anaki_disgust_scale_2014_1_comma_delimited_cleaned.csv

## You will deal with two variables: `Age`, `Mean_general_ds`

## PRE-CHECKS
## Generate box-plots and histograms of each of the variables and comment on normality (as per textbook definitions)
## Use expressions such as skewness and kurtosis to characterise the shape of the distributions.




## QUESTION 1
## Is there a relationship between `Age` and disgust sensitivity, `Mean_general_ds`?
## Show your work manually. Verify using built-in function. 
## Run diagnostics to ensure your calculations are good.




## QUESTION 2
## Standardize the two variables and recalculate the relationship
## Describe your findings




## Generate a scatterplot of the variables.
## Comment on the appearance.
