## Homework 4
############

## Load the PSYC2300 class survey data here.
## You can find the raw GitHub link in the usual location.


## Use the dependents variable for this homework. 


## Create two variables, one containing dependents of section A10 and one for A11. 
## Also, filter out blank values.


## Use the A10 data for this section of the calculations: 


## Compute the mean. Break out any calculation into a variable if you plan to 
## reuse the value later (e.g., sample size). Verify your work


## Compute the sums of squares. Make diagnostic remarks (indicators that indicate \
## you are on the right track)


## Compute the variance. Verify your calculation


## Compute the standard deviation. Verify your calculation


## Repeat the same steps for A11



## Use the method described in this Stack Overflow article to produce two histograms 
## blended together to show the number of dependents in each of the classes:
