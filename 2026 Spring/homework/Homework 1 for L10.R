## Homework 1

## Instructions
## Download this R Script and load it in your copy of R Studio
## Enter your answers as code below each question
## Save your work and upload to Moodle by the deadline
## If asking question on Signal Messenger, 
## post screenshots of errors of the entire R Studio screen (or take a photo of it)

## Create a variable and assign the number 10 to it. 

## for variable naming, as a standard: 
## come up with useful, descriptive names that you can remember later
## formatting possibilities: all in one word, capitalize the first letter of each
## separate words by a character such a . _ -
## cannot start a variable name with a number
## no special characters, especially no spaces or slashes or commas (and many other things)
## do not make a variable name the same as a function word
## e.g., mean() is a function. if you make your variable name mean, you set the path for confusion land
# mean <- 10
# mean
# mean(10,11,12)

## Create a second variable and assign the number 52 (which is the meaning of life, if you watched Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy)

## Add the two numbers together using their variable names

## Subtract the second variable from the first variable.

## Functions are built-in commands on R that do some internal computation
## For example, the function rm() deletes a variable from the global environment
## Delete the second variable from the global environment

## When you don't understand how a function works, you can type in
## the function's name with a question mark before it, like so ?rm()
## Type ?c() and read the help document (bottom right quadrant)

## Create a vector using c() that contains last week's measles infections by province.
## Use this link: https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/

## Check the class of the data set. 

## Convert the data to be an integer data type

## In R, you can create different data types. Until now you have been dealing with one type
## Using the class() function, find out what kind of data have you been dealing with
## Figure it for the first variable (the second one has been deleted), and for the vector your created.
