# Homework 10

# Using the 2025 version of the PSYC 2300 Stats Class data.

# Combine your knowledge of filters/subsetting with the equation shown in class 
# to compute probabilities for the problems below.
# You may use filters using the square bracket sequence [ xxx ], 
# functions such as length, and combining logical operations using &, ==, <, > 

# What is the probability that someone does no exercise at all in a week?

# What is the probability that someone is sleep deprived (assuming 8 hours/day x 7 days a week as normal)?

# What is the probability that someone consumes no caffeine at all in stats courses?

# ##############
# Define two groups of students: those who are currently enrolled in the course (Semester: 202510), and all those who took the course in the past (less than 202510)

# If you find someone who drinks no caffeine at all, are they more likely to be present students or past students?

# If you find someone who is exposed to over 56 hours of screen time per week, are they more likely to be present students or past students?

# If you find someone who is sleep deprived (as per earlier definition), are they more likely to be present students or past students?
