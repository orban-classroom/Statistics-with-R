## Homework 1

## Instructions
## Download this R Script and load it in your copy of R Studio
## Enter your answers as code below each question
## Save your work and upload to Moodle by the deadline
## If asking question on Signal Messenger, 
## post screenshots of errors of the entire R Studio screen (or take a photo of it)

## Create a variable with the number 10. 

## Create a second variable with the number 52 (which is the meaning of life, if you watched Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy)

## Add the two numbers together using their variable names

## Subtract the second variable from the first variable.

## Functions are built-in commands on R that do some internal computation
## For example, the function rm() deletes a variable from the global environment
## Delete the second variable from the global environment

## When you don't understand how a function works, you can type in
## the function's name with a question mark before it, like so ?rm()
## Type ?c() and read the help document (bottom right quadrant)

## Create a vector using c() that contains last week's measles infections by province.
## Use this link: https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/measles-rubella-surveillance/2024/week-16.html



## Check the class of the data set. 


## Convert the data to be an integer data type


## In R, you can create different data types. Until now you have been dealing with one type
## Using the class() function, find out what kind of data have you been dealing with
## Figure it for the first variable (the second one has been deleted), and for the vector your created.
