## File name on GitHub (inside the "Exams" folder): Rawlings_et_al_chimp_LT_personality_data.csv

## Variables you will use are: "Sex", "T1 agreeableness"


## NORMALITY
## Assess `T1 agreeableness` for normality. Draw on your of knowledge of normal curves, 
## skew, kurtosis, outliers, variability to make your conclusions. Use technical language (as per textbook) and visualizations.
## to support your arguments. Keep your work clean with headings and comment your code.








## CENTRAL TENDENCIES
## Where is the middle of the data for `T1 agreeableness`?
## Justify your answer using concepts of normality, and measures of central tendencies. 
## All calculations using the manual method (but you can use built-in functions for verification)
## Keep your work clean with headings and comment your code.






## Concept question: can you imagine any circumstances in which a median is a better metric of central tendencies than the mean?






## VARIABILITY
## Compute variance and standard deviation for `T1 agreeableness`.
## Keep your work clean with headings and comment your code. 
## Compute interim variables (deviation scores, sums of squares)








## FILTERING / SUBSETTING
## Finally, create one variable where we can see all `T1 agreeableness` values but only sex "1" 





## Create another variable where we can see all `T1 agreeableness` values but only for sex "2"
