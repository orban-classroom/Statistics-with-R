# Abstract: Personality factors analogous to the Big Five observed in humans are present in the great apes. However, 
# few studies have examined the long-term stability of great ape personality, particularly using factor-based personality 
# instruments. Here, we assessed overall group, and individual-level, stability of chimpanzee personality by collecting 
# ratings for chimpanzees (N = 50) and comparing them to ratings collected approximately 10 years previously, using the 
# same personality scale. The overall mean ratings of three of the six factors differed across the two time points. 
# Sex differences in personality were also observed, with overall sex differences found for three traits, and males and 
# females showing different trajectories for two further traits over the 10-year period. Regardless of sex, rank-order 
# stability analysis revealed strong stability for dominance; individuals who were dominant at the first time point were 
# also dominant 10 years later. The other personality factors exhibited moderate-to-weak rank-order stability indicating 
# that individuals were variable in their rank-position consistency over time. As many studies assessing chimpanzee 
# cognition rely on personality data collected several years prior to testing, these data highlight the importance of 
# collecting current personality data when correlating them with cognitive performance.

# Variable Definitions: 
# sex 1 = males, 2 = females

# Time definitions
#   T1 refers to the intial data collection (April 2006-December 2008, by Freeman et al. 2013). 
#   T2 refers to the ratings collected between (September 2015-December 2016).
