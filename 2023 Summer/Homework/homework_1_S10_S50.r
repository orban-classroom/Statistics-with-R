# Homework 1
# S10 & S50

# Instructions
# Download this R Script and load it in your copy of R Studio
# Enter your answers as code below each question
# Save your work and upload to Moodle by the deadline
# Post screenshots of errors of the entire R Studio screen (or take a photo of it)
# on the Signal classroom group. Do not private message me on technical questions
# because I would like everyone to troubleshoot together. 

# Decide on a variable naming scheme for your variables.
# Read up on naming schemes: https://www.r-bloggers.com/2014/07/consistent-naming-conventions-in-r/
# Using a hashtag comment below, state your naming format

# Create a variable with the number 10. 

# Create a second variable with the number 52 (which is the meaning of life, if you watched Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy)

# Add the two numbers together using their variable names

# Subtract the second variable from the first variable.

# Functions are built-in commands on R that do some internal computation
# For example, the function rm() deletes a variable from the global environment
# Delete the second variable from the global environment

# When you don't understand how a function works, you can type in
# the function's name with a question mark before it, like so ?rm()
# Type ?c() and read the help document (bottom right quadrant)

# Create a vector using c() that contains last week's BC lottery winning numbers (Google it)

# In R, you can create different data types. Until now you have been dealing with one type
# Using the class() function, find out what kind of data have you been dealing with
# Figure it for the first variable (the second one has been deleted), and for the vector your created.
