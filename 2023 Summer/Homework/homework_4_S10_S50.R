# Create a variable filtering for all rows containing 201910 (2019 Spring) semester


# Create a variable filtering for all rows containing 202310 (2023 Spring) semester


# Compute the mean, median and mode for each 201910 and 202310 data separately, below, using the manual method


# Comment on your observations of the central tendency measures. Comments both in terms of differences between mean, median and mode numbers and what they reveal about the data, and differences between the two semesters. 


# Create a histogram of each semester's data. Make it look fancy: include labels, colour it nicely, dress it up.


# Comment on the shape of the histogram. Use expressions such as skew and kurtosis (based on your visual inspection).
