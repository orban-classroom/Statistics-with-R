# R Homework 2

# Follow these stylistic conventions
# 1. Have your own system of variable naming, and stick to it. I will be looking for consistency.
# 2. Use a single hashtag # for your comments. I will use ## for my comments.
# Use spaces carefully to organize your code. Make it readable. You can use hashtags to add headings and comments to your code.
