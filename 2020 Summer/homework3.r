# R Homework 3

# Follow these stylistic conventions
# 1. Have your own system of variable naming, and stick to it. I will be looking for consistency.
# 2. Use a single hashtag # for your comments. I will use ## for my comments.
# Use spaces carefully to organize your code. Make it readable. You can use hashtags to add headings and comments to your code.

# Compute the variance, manually. 

# Compute the variance with the built-in function. 


# Compute the standard deviation, manually. 


# Compute the standard deviation using the built-in function. 


# Compute the kurtosis of this data

# Interpret the kurtosis value -- use a hashtag and add your comments below this line

# Compute the skewness of this data

# Interpret the skewness value -- use a hashtag and add your comments below this line


# Summarize the data


# Compute the standard score for the third value in the data set. Use subsetting as described in the textbook earlier: examdata[3]

### INTRODUCING DATA FRAMES ##
##############################

# For this part of the exercise, review the Lecturelet on (1) creating data frames, and (2) loading data from the Internet

# A face-to-face 2300 class in 2019 generated some data on their characteristics such as the number of hours of sleep, screentime, exercise, coffee and work they had weekly. 

# Load the data here into a data frame. 

# Raw link must be used for R: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llorban/KPU-Statistics-2300/master/2019%20Summer/data/2300dataExpanded.csv
# Pretty link can be used for you to view the data before: https://github.com/llorban/KPU-Statistics-2300/blob/master/2019%20Summer/data/2300dataExpanded.csv



# Run a correlation between hours of work weekly vs hours of exercise weekly. 


# Interpret the result
