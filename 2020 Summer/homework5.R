# Note: From now onwards, you will work with the time_at_bin variable


# Generate a histogram of the time_at_bin variable


# Interpret the meaning of the histogram - is the distribution normal?


# Produce a bar graph showing the mean proportion_correct for condition 1 & 2 (watch Lecturelet first)


# Produce a boxplot showing the mean proportion_correct for condition 1 & 2 (watch Lecturelet first)


# Compute the kurtosis for proportion_correct, for condition 1 & 2


# Compute the skewness for proportion_correct, for condition 1 & 2


# What are your observations when you compare the boxplot with the kurtosis and skewness values? Add them here as a comment.
