## 2016, Wu, DiGiacomo, Lenkic, Wong and Kingstone (UBC)
## ABSTRACT: Previous observational work revealed that transient populations in a sustainable building disposed of 
## waste more accurately when compared to patrons in a non-sustainable building. The current study uses an experimental 
## design to replicate this observed effect and to investigate whether or not the built environment influences motivational 
## factors to impact behavior. We find support that a building designed and built to communicate an atmosphere of sustainability 
## can influence waste disposal behavior. Participants in the sustainable build- ing used the garbage receptacle significantly 
## less and compensated by tending to select the containers and organics receptacle more, which actually resulted in more errors 
## overall. Our findings suggest that building atmospherics can motivate people to recycle more. How- ever, atmospherics alone 
## do not appear to be sufficient to elicit the desired performance outcome.

## 1. Load any libraries needed for this notebook (2 points)


## 2. Import the data as a data frame (2 points)


## 3. What is the sample size? (2 points for the code that displays sample size, nothing else)


## 4. What is the sum of all scores for each variables in the data frame? (4 points for the code that displays the sum of all scores, nothing else)


## 5. What is the mean, the manual way, for both "proportion correct" and "time at bin" variables? (8 points, display the value)


## 6. Use the built-in function to compute the mean for "proportion correct" and "time at bin" (4 points)


## 7. What is the median of "proportion correct" and "time at bin" variables (2 points for the code that displays the values)


## 8. What is the mode of "proportion correct" and "time at bin" variables (2 points for the code that displays the values)


## 9. What is the range of scores of the "proportion correct" and "time at bin" variables?  (4 points for the code that displays the value)


## 10. Compute the sums of squares for both "proportion correct" and "time at bin" variables, as described in my screencast (10 points for the code that displays the values)


## 12. Compute the variance of both "proportion correct" and "time at bin" variables, the manual way (8 points for the code that displays the values)


## 13. Verify your variance answers using the built-in variance function (4 points)


## 14. Compute the standard deviation for both variables, the manual way (8 points points for the code that displays the values)


## 15. Verify your answer using the built-in standard deviation function (4 points)


## 16. Compute the correlation coefficient, r, between the "proportion correct" and "time at bin" variables. (4 points for the code that displays the value)


## 17. What conclusion can you draw from the correlation answer in 15? (6 points, add comments as a haghtag remark)

## 18. What is the standard score of the 3rd, 6th, and 9th value on the time at bin variable (6 points)?

## DATASET 2
## Raw Link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llorban/KPU-Statistics-2300/master/2019%20Spring/data/chimpstudy/chimpcookingstudy.csv
##
## 2015 Warneken and Rosati
## Data Synposis: The transition to a cooked diet represents an important shift in human ecology and evolution. 
## Cooking requires a set of sophisticated cognitive abilities, including causal reasoning, 
## self-control and anticipatory planning. Do humans uniquely possess the cognitive capacities 
## needed to cook food? We address whether one of humans' closest relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),
## possess the domain-general cognitive skills needed to cook. The percentage of cooked column in this data set
## indicates the preference of chimpanzees for cooked food over raw food. Subject names refer to individual chimps.

## Load the data into a dataframe (2 points)

## What is the sample size? (2 points)

## There is one variable with numeric data. Which one is that? (2 points)

## What is the sum of all scores? (2 points)

## What is the mean, the manual way, on the choice_cooked_percent column? (2 points)

## What is the median on the choice_cooked_percent column? (2 points)

## What is the mode of the choice_cooked_percent column?  (2 points)

## What is the minimum, maximum and range of scores of the choice_cooked_percent column?  (6 points)

## What is the interquartile range of choice_cooked_percent column? (4 points)

## Conceptual: Based on your reading of the descriptive statistics, do you think chimps prefer 
## cooked foods? Explain. (6 points)
