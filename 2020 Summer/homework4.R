# R Homework 4

# Follow these stylistic conventions
# 1. Have your own system of variable naming, and stick to it. I will be looking for consistency.
# 2. Use a single hashtag # for your comments. I will use ## for my comments.
# Use spaces carefully to organize your code. Make it readable. You can use hashtags to add headings and comments to your code.

# Load the data


# Note: From now onwards, you will work with the time_at_bin variable


# Compute the mean, manually


# Double check your work by computing the mean using the built-in mean() function


# Compute the deviation score vector (page 126, 2nd column)


# Compute the square of the deviation score vector (page 126, 3rd column)


# Compute the sum of squares (add up the values found in the squared deviation score vector)


# Compute the degrees of freedom


# Compute the variance, the correct way


# Compute the variance, the incorrect way, as described in the textbook


# Compute the variance using the built-in function


# Compute the standard deviation, manually


# Compute the standard deviation using the built-in function


# Compute the kurtosis of this data


# Interpret the kurtosis value -- use a hashtag and add your comments below this line


# Compute the skewness of this data


# Interpret the skewness value -- use a hashtag and add your comments below this line


# Compute the standard score for the second value in the data set. Use subsetting as described in the textbook earlier: examdata[3]


# Run a correlation between time_at_bin vs proportion_correct


# Interpret the result
